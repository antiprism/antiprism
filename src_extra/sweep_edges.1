.SH NAME
sweep_edges - sweep edges to make a surface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sweep
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,input\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read input model in OFF format and transform it multiple times to produce
a polygonal surface made of the quadrilaterals swept by the edges. At
each step the input model is transformed according to the specified
transformations, which can be defined using sweep progress variables FRAC
and ANG. FRAC runs from 0.0 at at step 0 to 1.0 on the final step.
.IP
FRAC = current_step / total_steps
ANG = 360.0 * FRAC
.PP
Colours are taken from the input model if the begining of the sweep does
not coincide with the end, or if option \fB\-O\fR is set, otherwise sweep circuits
are found and the colours are set from the colour map (option \fB\-m\fR). Vertex
colours are used for final vertices and swept vertex edges, edge colours
are used for swept edge faces.
If input is not given the program reads from standard input.

\fB\-h\fR,\-\-help this help message (run 'off_util \fB\-H\fR help' for general help)
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR version information
.TP
\fB\-n\fR <int>
number of steps (default: 12)
.HP
\fB\-T\fR <tran> translate, three numbers separated by commas which are
.IP
used as the x, y and z displacements
.TP
\fB\-R\fR <rot>
rotate about an axis, three, four or six numbers separated by
commas. If three numbers these are angles (degrees) to rotate
about the x, y and z axes. If four numbers, the first three
are a direction vector for the axis, the last number is the
angle (degrees) to rotate. If six numbers, these are two
vectors (from,to) and rotate to carry the first to the second.
If twelve numbers these are four vectors (from1,from2,to1,to2)
and rotate to carry the first onto the third then rotate around
the third to carry the second onto the fourth
.HP
\fB\-M\fR <norm> reflect in a plane, three numbers separated by commas which
.IP
give a vector normal to the plane of reflection.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR <scal> scale, one, three or four numbers separated by commas. If one
.IP
number then scale by this factor in all directions. If three
numbers these are the factors to scale along the x, y and
z axes. If four numbers, the first three are a direction
vector for the scaling, the last number is the factor to scale
.TP
\fB\-I\fR
inversion
.HP
\fB\-A\fR <crds> transformation that will align two sets of three points
.IP
(18 numbers coordinates of from1,from2,from3,to1,to2,to3)
.HP
\fB\-a\fR <angs> transformation that makes particular angles between the
.IP
mapped axes, angles in degrees in form yz_ang,zx_ang,xy_ang
(corresponding to the angles opposite the x\-, y\- and z\-axis)
.HP
\fB\-X\fR <mtrx> transformation matrix of 9 or 12 values, given left\-to\-right
.IP
top\-to\-bottom, used to premultipy each coordinate
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
replace the current combined transformation by its inverse
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
triangulate
.TP
\fB\-O\fR
do not join coincident sweep ends
.TP
\fB\-l\fR <lim>
maximum distance between vertices that should be coincident, lim
is an integer represeting the negative exponent of the distance
(default: 8 giving 1e\-08)
.HP
\fB\-m\fR <maps> a comma separated list of colour maps used to transform colour
.IP
indexes (default: rand), a part consisting of letters from
v, e, f, selects the element types to apply the map list to
(default 'vef'). The 'compound' map should give useful results.
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
