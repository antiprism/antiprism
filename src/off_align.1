.SH NAME
off_align - alignment of OFF files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B off_align
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIinput_file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a base file and brick file in OFF format, and use vertices or faces
to position the brick with respect to the base. The brick may be repeated
symmetrically and/or merged with the base. If input_file is not given the
program reads from standard input.

\fB\-\-version\fR version information
.TP
\fB\-v\fR <arg>
align by vertices, iarg is a comma separated list of a brick
geometry (if empty use base) optionally followed by 'r' (reverse
brick orientation) followed by two, four or six points given as
the vertex index number in the OFF files (starting at 0). The base
points are all given first and then the brick points.
Formats:
.IP
u1,v1 \- point alignment
.IP
translation u1\-v1 (so v1 of brick moves to u1 of base)
.IP
u1,u2,v1,v2 \- line alignment
.IP
point alignment as above followed by rotation through
u1 perpendicular to u1u2 and v1v2 to align u1u2 and v1v2.
.IP
u1,u2,u3,v1,v2,v3 \- face alignment
.IP
line alignment as above followed by a rotation
around u1,u2 so v3 lies in plane of u1u2u3.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR <arg>
align by face index, arg is a comma separated list of a brick
geometry (if empty use base) followed by up to three numbers
separated by commas: base face index, brick face index
(default: 0), polygon alignment selection number (default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-F\fR <arg>
align and combine polyhedra by face index, arg is a comma
separated list of a brick geometry (if empty use base) followed
by up to three numbers: base face index, brick face index
(default: 0), polygon alignment selection number (default: 0).
Brick is after base, bond vertices are merged, bond faces are
removed
.TP
\fB\-M\fR <val>
merge files. 0 (default) don't merge, 1 brick after
base, 2 brick before base
.TP
\fB\-y\fR <sub>
repeat bricks according to symmetry of base. sub is symmetry
subgroup (Schoenflies notation) or 'full' optionally followed
by a ',' and conjugation type (integer)
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
