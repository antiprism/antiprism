.SH NAME
geodesic - geodesic spheres
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B geodesic
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a file in OFF format and make a higher frequency, plane\-faced
polyhedron or geodesic sphere. If input_file is not given the program
reads from standard input

Options
.HP
\fB\-h\fR,\-\-help this help message (run 'off_util \fB\-H\fR help' for general help)
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR version information
.HP
\fB\-f\fR <freq> pattern frequency, a positive integer (default: 1) giving the
.IP
number of repeats of the specified pattern along an edge
.HP
\fB\-F\fR <freq> final step frequency, minimum number of edges to move between
.IP
base vertices in the geodesic model. For a pattern m,n the
step frequency is pattern_frequency/(m+n)
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <clss> face division pattern,
1 (Class I, default), 2 (Class II), or
.IP
two numbers separated by a comma to determine the pattern
(Class III, but n,0 or 0,n is Class I, and n,n is Class II)
.HP
\fB\-M\fR <mthd> Method of applying the frequency pattern:
.IP
s \- geodesic sphere (default). The pattern grid is formed
.IP
from divisions along each edge that make an equal angle
at the centre. The geodesic vertices are centred at the
origin and projected on to a unit sphere.
.IP
p \- planar. The pattern grid is formed from equal length
.IP
divisions along each edge, the new vertices lie on the
surface of the original polyhedron.
.HP
\fB\-C\fR <cent> centre of points, in form \e"x_val,y_val,z_val\e" (default: 0,0,0)
.IP
used for geodesic spheres
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
