.B leonardo
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,input_file\/\fR]

\fB\-w\fR <wdth> width of the perimeter border of the faces, follow by % for

percentage of maximum width without overlap (default: 30%)
.TP
\fB\-l\fR <ht>
height to thicken faces, 0 for single polygon height, follow by
% for percentage of width value (default: 100%)

use centroid (default: no centre, use calculated vertex normals)
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
faces converted to panels without holes (incompatible with
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-e\fR)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
distribute the height equally on both sides of the faces, so
the original faces would lie in the middle of the new faces
(use for non\-orientable models)
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
hide the edges that join the outside of a face to the hole
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
take colours from the edge colours of the base polyhedron
(default: use face colours)
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
keep orientation, don't try to orient the faces
