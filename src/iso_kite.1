.SH NAME
iso_kite - isohedral kite-faced polyhedra
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iso_kite
[\fIoptions\fR] \fImodel_args\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Create all isohedral polyhedra and polyhedron compounds whose face type
is a kite (or dart)
.PP
Model_args can be a Schwarz triangle name (which can also be given as two
or three fractions A, B, C (default 2) which specify the Schwarz triangle
vertices, where n/d corresponds to an angle PI*d/n), optionally followed by
a permutation letter from AaBbCc, to rotate the fraction A, B, or C to the
front (and if lowercase then follow by swapping the last two fractions)

.PP
If model_args is a single fraction then make a trapezohedron (with B and C
as antiprism vertices).
The kite has vertices along A, C, B, and C reflected in AB. The height of up
to two vertices may be given, and the third is calculated (B and C have
the same height in a trapezohedron). If less than two heights are given
the calculated vertex will be B, if not specified, otherwise A. The kite
is repeated with the symmetry corresponding to the base Schwarz triangle,
or trapezohedron model.
Notes: the tetrahedral triangles T1 and T2 both produce a model with
octahedral symmetry when height A=\-B (cube and rhombic dodecahedron,
respectively). These models do not form an octahedral compound, and have
common symmetry subgroup of Th in the icosahedral compounds. The 3
trapezohedron also has octahedral symmetry at height A=+/\-B (cube), and
likewise has a common symmetry subgroup of Th in icosahedral compounds.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR num
\&'list' will list all compounds of the specified base model, or
all models and compounds if no base model specified. The list
includes a model number and base model, and if a compound, the
alignment symmetry (possibly with realignment number) and final
symmetry (and possibly a final pre\-realignment number).
Specifying a number will make the the model with that number
in the list.
