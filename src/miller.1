.SH NAME
miller - Miller's stellations of the icosahedron
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B miller
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,input\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Millers 59 Icosahedra Stellations. Plus additional stellations since discovered
input may be Miller list number from 1 to 75. Or m_string where string consists
of one or more cell names: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,e1,f1,f1',g1,e2,f2,g2  e.g m_De1f1g1
model string can be followed by I or Ih symmetry. e.g. m_e1f1',I
