.SH NAME
off_util - utilities for OFF files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B off_util
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,input_files\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read one or more files in OFF format, combine them into a single file and
process it. Most operations manipulate elements, such as adding, deleting,
and combining elements, triangulating and orientimg faces, making an edge
skeleton, and rounding the precision of coordinates. Other miscellaneous
operations include projection onto a sphere, creating a net, truncating
vertices, and converting edges to quadrilaterals. Operations are performeded
in the order they are given on the command line. input_files is the list of
files to process, which may include 'null' as an empty geometry, or if not
given the program reads from standard input.

Options
.HP
\fB\-h\fR,\-\-help this help message (run 'off_util \fB\-H\fR help' for general help)
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR version information
.HP
\fB\-M\fR <args> Sort and merge elements whose coordinates are the same to
.TP
the number of decimal places given by option \fB\-l\fR.
args is 1 or 2
.IP
comma separated parts. The first part is the elements to merge,
which can include: v \- vertices, e \- edges, f \- faces,
a \- all (vef), b \- bond (merge 've' and delete any face
coincident with another), s \- sort without merging.
The second part (default 3) is the merge blend color:
first=1, last=2, rgb=3, ryb=4
.TP
\fB\-l\fR <lim>
minimum distance for unique vertex locations as negative
exponent (default: 12 giving 1e\-12)
.TP
\fB\-O\fR <opt>
orient the faces first (if possible) then adjust for signed
volume, value may be: positive, negative, reverse, or flip
(which reverses the orientation of the model as it was input)
.TP
\fB\-T\fR <rat>
truncate vertices by cutting edges at a ratio from each vertex,
can also be 'rat,num' to truncate only vertices of order num
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
skeleton, write the face edges and remove the faces
.HP
\fB\-t\fR <disp> triangulate, include face parts according to winding number
.IP
from: odd, nonzero, positive, negative, triangulate (synonym
for nonzero)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
geometry only, remove all colours, remove all two\-vertex faces
(edges) that are also a face edge
.HP
\fB\-x\fR <elms> remove OFF face elements. The element string is processed in
.IP
order and can include v, e, f to remove OFF faces with one
vertex (vertices), two\-vertices (edges) and three or more
vertices (faces), V to remove vertices that are not part
of any face or edge, E to remove two\-vertex faces (edges)
that are not part of any face, D to remove two\-vertex faces (edges)
that are also a face edge (decorators), F to remove faces that
do not share a vertex with another face
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
Fill in missing explicit edges
.HP
\fB\-D\fR <list> delete a list of elements, list starts with element letter,
.IP
followed by an index number list, given as index ranges separated
by commas. range can be one number or two numbers separated by a
hyphen (default range numbers: 0 and largest index). Element
letters may also be F or E to delete compound parts by part number.
Index number list may be preceded by f, e, v, E or F to find
elements based on connectivity to another element type or part.
Compound parts may also be found by element number. Only elements
specifically specified are deleted. list can have a suffix '%' to
invert results. e or E only act on explicit edges. If some explicit
edges are missing, use \fB\-e\fR to fill them in
special connectivity selectors: o \- vertices by vertex order
.IP
s \- faces by number of sides, or to select by a color...
x \- vertex color, y \- edge color, z \- face color
.HP
\fB\-K\fR <list> keep a list of elements using the same parameters as \fB\-D\fR. Only
.IP
elements specifically specified are kept along with their vertex
and edge decorators if present. Implicit edges which are kept are
converted to explicit edges
.HP
\fB\-A\fR <elem> add element, elem is element letter (v, e, f), followed by
.IP
element data, optionally followed by ':' and a colour. Data is
.IP
v: three comma separated coordinates
e: a comma separated list of index numbers, joined as a ring
f: a comma separated list of index numbers
.IP
negative index numbers are relative to the end of the vertex
list, last vertex is \fB\-1\fR (useful to refer to added vertices.)
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <col>
close polyhedron, each hole converted to a face with colour col,
holes having a vertex with more than two open edges are not filled
.TP
\fB\-S\fR
project onto unit sphere centred at origin
.HP
\fB\-u\fR <args> unfold a polyhedron into a net, takes up to three comma separated
.IP
values for base face index, dihedral fraction (normally 1.0 to
\fB\-1\fR.0, default: 0.0 flat), and final option letters: 'f' centre
on centroid of face centres, 'z' align base face normal to z_axis.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR <dgts> number of significant digits (default 16) or if negative
.IP
then the number of digits after the decimal point
.HP
\fB\-o\fR <file> write output to file (default: write to standard output)
