         Changes
            Resource models: element index numbers may have changed. 
            Uniform polyhedra (U models) calculated by formula
              rather than "kaleido" code (Roger Kaufman)
            Standard uniform models use new U models, many resource
               models may be prefixed by std_ (Roger Kaufman).
            New resource models: Wythoff construction (wythoff_ ),
               Schwarz triangle (schwarz_), regular polygon (pol)
            lat_util: -R takes extra blending option
